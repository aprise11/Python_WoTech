```py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pokemon_df = pd.read_csv('/content/Pokemon.csv')

pokemon_df.head(n=5)
```
```py
# Create two DataFrame : Grass and Water
grass_data = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Grass'] 
water_data = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Water']
```
```py
# Create the regression plots for each (Grass and Water)
import seaborn as sns

plt.show()

sns.regplot(x=water_data['Attack'], y=water_data['Defense'])
